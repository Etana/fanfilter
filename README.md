## `:>quantified` and `:<quantified`

for some criterias (`chapter`, `fav`, `follow`, `pair`, `published`, `review`, `updated`, `words`) the term can be quantified more specifically, for example:

- `updated:<3month` will search stories updated since 3 months ago
- `fav:>4000` will search stories with more than 4000 favorites
- `words:>4242 words:<8585` will search for stories between 4243 and 8584 words
- `pair:3` search pairing with 3 characters

for date type (published and updated), a quantifier can be used at the end:

- `y`, `year`, `years`: will be a number of year
- `m`, `month`, `months`: will be a number of month
- `w`, `week`, `weeks`: will be a number of week
- `d`, `day`, `days`: will be a number of day

with only a number, the default meaning is a number of days (eg. p:>200days is the same that p:>200)

## `pair:charA/charB`

value is split over `/` and filter will match if all part are matching a pairing

a part beginning with `-` will only match if it is not inside the pairing, eg. `pair:hermione/-draco` will only match if there is a pairing with `hermione` and without `draco`

pairings are also searched in the summary, so all these `HarryXHermione`, `Harry x Hermione`, `Harry/Hermione`, `HarryHermione` would match `pair:harry/hermione`
